# YamFlix

YamFlix is a React-based web application that allows users to search for different movies using the OMDb movie database API, providing them with different statistics about the movie, as well as a poster visual and general description of the movie's plot. Users can then select movies they've watched, give them a rating, and add them to a watched list to help keep track of their favorites. The application also includes custom hooks to enhance user interactions and supports local storage to maintain movie data between sessions.

## Features

- **Search Movies**: Users can search for movies by title using the OMDb API.
- **Movie Details**: View detailed information about each movie, including the title, release year, plot, and poster.
- **Watched List**: Add movies to a personal watched list.
- **Ratings**: Rate movies after watching them.
- **Custom Hooks**: Utilize custom hooks to handle key presses and manage the movie selection and adding process.
- **Local Storage**: Store movie data in local storage to maintain access between sessions.
